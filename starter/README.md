# Capstone Casting Agency

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

## Database Setup

With Postgres running, restore a database using the agency.psql file provided:

```bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db upgrade
psql -U postgres agency < agency.psql
```

## Running the server

First ensure you are working using your created virtual environment. To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
